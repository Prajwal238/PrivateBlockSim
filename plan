step-1: Input Parameters
	1.1 -> confiq.json
	1.2 -> delays.json
	1.3 -> latency.json
step-2: Establish simulation world and network
step-3: Create Organizations
	3.1 -> create organizations
	3.2 -> create peers,ordering service
-----------------------------------------------
                Completed
-----------------------------------------------
step-4: Create Channels
	4.1 -> create channels
	4.2 -> put some random organization and their peers in each channel
		4.2.1 -> one of the organization peer will be admin
		4.2.2 -> some organization/s peers need to be endorsers
		4.2.3 -> create genesis block for each peer(maintain ledger)
	4.3 ->put chaincode
	4.4 ->put endorement policy
	4.5 ->Establish a connection b/w peer-to-peer in each channel
step-5: Generate Transactions
	5.1 -> transaction b/w sender to receiver send to endosers 
	5.2 -> endosers approve the transcation based on chaincode
	5.3 -> transcation id and value need to store 
step-6: Ordering service
	6.1 -> certain number of transaction in each channel goes to ordeing service
	6.2 -> ordering service make a block by RAFT consenses algorithm
	6.3 -> block propagates to all the peers in channel
step-7: Validate the block by each peer in channel by PBFT.
step-8: Adding the block to ledger
